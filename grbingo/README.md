# Golden Ratio Bingo

This is a project created for the /r/thegoldenratio4 subreddit as a fun way to play bingo based on content that frequently comes up in social media account about a family of 5 golden retrievers.

The project takes in a Google Sheet with a list of common scenarios that happen to the dogs, such as "Venk did a dance at dinner time". The program randomly selects 24 entries from the spreadsheet, and a "Free Space" and generates a 5 x 5 Bingo Card Grid of scenarios to be checked off.
